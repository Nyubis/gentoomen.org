<h2><a name="1.">1. Little about us</a></h2>
<p>One time, one of our current members felt pretty bored. He created a thread on 4chan's /g/ where
he proposed to teach programming (in Python) to those with no programming experience. Around 20 people, some complete newbs, some already accomplished programmers, joined up - #/g/sicp @ Rizon was the result. Since then, the project grew.</p>
<h4>We currently:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Have projects where all collaborate as a learning experience.
    <ul><li>Bhottu, our IRC bot, was the result of one of such experiences. Lots of people learned intermediate Python as a result.</li></ul>
    <li>Work together on tutorials.
    <ul><li>Our first one was Python, then C++ appeared (still in need of collaborators). Much more are planned.</li></ul>
    <li>Have a friendly community for aspiring and expert programmers to exchange insights.</li>
    <li>Occasionally post porn and such.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="2.">2. Projects</a></h2>
<p>Since everything we do is project based, you can participate in every area and subject you are
intrested in and think you have something to give. Though sometimes it's encouraged to do occasional
mundane tasks that may not be so intresting, but would benefit the community. Like this website.. which needs work btw. </p>
<p>Also we are very open for all sorts of ideas, so feel free suggest even silly things.
Want to learn a language? You could suggest a project using it.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1.">2.1. Git</a></h3>
<p>We use git as our main tool for collaboration. Git is a distributed revision control system,
which allows multiple persons to participate on a software project. It tracks changes in software
made by users and allows a lot of control in versions. Even updates and edits to this website is handled trough git.</p>
<p>We have a organization called gentoomen in github, which acts as an umbrella for different
projects. You can ask access to the repositories in our irc channel.</p>
<p>There is going to be a short tut on how to use git and links for learning materials here, when somebody writes it.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="2.2.">2.2. Tutorials</a></h3>
<p>You can find our tutorials here, they could be moved on a separate page at some point, but for now they are listed here.</p>
<p>Help write more tutorials for us to use. From beginner topics to advanced. Anything from
programming and scripting to general tech howto goes. Though it's preferred to concentrate on
beginner tuts first, so we can provide beginners
means to start learning on a specific subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tutorials/cplusplus.html">C++ tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="tutorials/python.html">Python tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

Here is a <a href="tutorials/README.txt">README</a> for tutorial writers.
