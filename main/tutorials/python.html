1. Why should Python be your first language, you ask?
=====================================================

    - Python is easy to get started with, it has vey simple syntax
    - Very expressive, allows you to focus on the solutions to problems instead of the language
    - Not a fucking toy language, is awesome at gluing together shit
    - FIOC, Forced Indentation of Code, which makes sure your code doesn't look retarded
    - It's a high level language, meaning you don't have concentrate on memory management etc.
    - Interpreted, meaning you can get feedback faster
    - Portable, it works and runs on most platforms



*Okay then, why not some other language
##rewriting needed here
In most cases, compiled languages are better performance-wise. Python isn't compiled, it's interpreted.

Compilation vs. Interpretation

Compilation means that the code must be "translated" to machine code (the shit your processor understands) before you run your program.
Well, interpretation also, but it is done on the fly.

Pros for Interpretation:
* Interpretation supports a quick Write-Review-Modify cycle, which
   benefits quickly written scripts. Compilation doesn't usually have this
    advantage, with longer compilation times increading Write-Review-Modify cycle

Cons for Interpretation:
* Generally has worse performance

Pros for Compilation:
* Generally generates faster code

Cons for Compilation:
* Compilation doesn't usually have interpreted code's advantage,
with longer compilation times increading Write-Review-Modify cycle duration.

Thus, we believe an interpreted language is the ideal for beginners.

Get your hands dirty

We'll be using Python 2.x (any version 2 Python interpreter will do).

Where to get it:

*nix systems (macs included) already have it installed 99% of times, go to your terminal and type
python --version
If it succeeds, congrats. If not, download the appropriate version at

http://www.python.org/download/
(this is also valid for Windows users)
Remember to get 2.7.1

Download, install, etc. We're not getting into much detail since it's pretty well documented.
THE NUMBER ONE TOOL FOR ASPIRING PROGRAMMERS IS GOOGLE.
The problem you have? Probably thousands of other people already had it before and posted it online.
Continuing.

The Python Interpreter

Python has an interactive interpreter, launched by the python command (for windows users, select "Python (command line)" from your start menu). It should look similar to this:

Python 2.6.5 (release26-maint, Oct 29 2010, 23:43:31)
[GCC 4.4.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

Here, statements can be evaluated and functions executed.

You can use it as a calculator:
>>> 2+2
4

BABBY'S FIRST PROGRAM

Yes, it's boring, but bear with me.

>>> print "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!

As you can see, the print command tells the interpreter "I want this displayed to the user!".
Notice that there are double quotes (") around the text, but they aren't printed. They're used to delimit the text. Text surrounded by quotes is called a "string" in programming jargon. A string of characters.

How about something more interactive? We could prompt the user for a name, and we can greet that name afterwards. That's easy.

>>> name = input("Your name: ")
Your name: rms
>>> print "hello,", name
Hello, rms

This introduced a bunch of new concepts.

input("Your name: ") is a function. . Functions have parameters, which modify their behavior.
In this case, the parameter is the prompt to be displayed to the user.


name is a variable. A variable has 3 attributes:

Its symbol, how you address it: in this case, it's name.
Its value, what it contains: in this case, the user input is "rms", so that's its value.
For completeness' sake, the third attribute is the value's location in memory, but
